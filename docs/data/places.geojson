Not a great whiskey cocktail selection, but cocktails are all good. 1st Visit: We only did mussels and cocktails here. Mussels were pretty solid. Cocktails were good. Kombuchanist was probably the best we had. Flavor appears to change seasonally, but it was good. Good selection of cocktails.",

Very coffee-ey. Really good. Jasmine Milk Punch was really good. A little boozey, but good. The biscuits were excellent. Like, really exceptional biscuits. The biscuit with gravy was really good. The biscuit with butter and jam was really good. We also had the creamy polenta. It was good. Not sure Id order again, but we were expecting something a little different. Was more like grits.",

        "Notes": "Chips and Guac are very good. Chips are homemade and excellent. The guac isnt flashy, but very good. Brad had Barbacoa, carne asada and chorizo. Barbacoa was very good. Best of the 3. Carne asada was a little dry. Chorizo was really good. Sarah had shrimp and carnitas. Shrimp was good. Carnitas was really good. Definitely would order the chorizo, carnitas, and barbacoa again. Shrimp was good enough to order again if you want shrimp. TRIP 2: al pastor is very good. Chicken is good, not great. Currently ranking: 1) Barbacoa 2) Al pastor/carnitas 3) chorizo 4) chicken Queso is good. Nothing special. Not excellent. But if you want queso, it will hit the spot. Cucumber Fresca is banging.",
